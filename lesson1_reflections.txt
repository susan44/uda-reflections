How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It saved time having to compare the two files manually

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Help you find mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Con is that you have to think about it and remember to do it, ie it's not automatic.  
Pro that it is more logically useful, and you can add comments to each commit



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
you know you will always be able to go back to the version that worked.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
did not finish actually setting up the workspace.  There are lots of things here that may make using git-bash easier.  I will come back later and do them if I see the need.
